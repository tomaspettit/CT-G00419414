### Problem 1
Implement the following functions in Python.
Use numpy to ensure that all variables and values are treated as 32-bit integers.
These functions are defined in the Secure Hash Standard [see page 10](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).

1. `Parity(x, y, z)`
2. `Ch(x, y, z)`
3. `Maj(x, y, z)`
4. `Sigma0(x)` - written as $\Sigma_0^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
5. `Sigma1(x)` - written as $\Sigma_1^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
6. `sigma0(x)` - written as $\sigma_0^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
7. `sigma1(x)` - written as $\sigma_1^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
