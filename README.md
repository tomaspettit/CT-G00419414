### Problem 1
Implement the following functions in Python.
Use numpy to ensure that all variables and values are treated as 32-bit integers.
These functions are defined in the Secure Hash Standard [see page 10](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf).

1. `Parity(x, y, z)`
2. `Ch(x, y, z)`
3. `Maj(x, y, z)`
4. `Sigma0(x)` - written as $\Sigma_0^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
5. `Sigma1(x)` - written as $\Sigma_1^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
6. `sigma0(x)` - written as $\sigma_0^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.
7. `sigma1(x)` - written as $\sigma_1^{\{256\}}(x)$ in the standard.

### Problem 2
Use numpy to calculate the constants listed at the bottom of page 11 of the Secure Hash Standard, following the steps below.
These are the first 32 bits of the fractional parts of the cube roots of the first 64 prime numbers.

1. Write a function called `primes(n)` that generates the first n prime numbers.

2. Use the function to calculate the cube root of the first 64 primes.

3. For each cube root, extract the first thirty-two bits of the fractional part.

4. Display the result in hexadecimal.

5. Test the results against what is in the Secure Hash Standard.
